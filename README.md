This is the official implementation of **Sat2Density++**.

---

### 📝 TL;DR
We propose **Sat2Density++**, a novel framework for high-quality street-view video synthesis from satellite imagery:
- **Minimal Training Requirements**: It only requires $N$ pairs of GPS-matched satellite and street-view panorama images. **No** video data and **no** 3D annotations are needed during training.
- **Flexible Inference**: Given a single satellite image and a user-defined driving trajectory, the model generates a temporally consistent panorama video.
- **Superior Performance**: Sat2Density++ significantly outperforms the previous conference version (**Sat2Density**). Visual comparisons are available on our [Project Page](https://qianmingduowan.github.io/sat2density-pp/).

### 📅 TODO List
- [ ] **By Jan 24**: Update the arXiv preprint to the journal version.
- [ ] **By Jan 31**: Release the inference code.
- [ ] **By Feb 16**: Release the training code.
